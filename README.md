# About-Me
More insight into my other (private) projects and myself!

I am a freshman at MIT studying 6-4 (Artificial Intelligence and Decision Making) with a minor in Economics. 

As of fall 2023, I have completed extensive lab-work in 6.1010 (Fundamentals in Programming) at MIT. Unfortunately, I cannot publish my work to the public (that is if I want to graduate without getting into serious trouble). Some of my favorite projects involved:

* Image processing
  * hand-programming kernels to apply custom filters
  * seam carving
* Lots of BFS!
* conjunctive normal form (CNF) boolean solver
* Object Oriented Programming
* Creating and traversing through custom-made graph datastructures
* Python-based LISP interpreter

Overall, I really enjoyed the clas and would love to TA it some time in the very near future.

Please feel free to reach out to me via linkedin if you would like to get in touch!
