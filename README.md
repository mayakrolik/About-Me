# About-Me
More insight into my other (private) projects and myself!

I am a freshman at MIT studying 6-4 (Artificial Intelligence and Decision Making) with a minor in Economics. 

Extensive lab-work from 6.1010 (Fundamentals in Programming) from MIT. Unfortunately I cannot publish these to the public (that is if I want to graduate without getting into serious trouble). Some of my favorite projects include:

* Image projessing
* * hand-programming kernels to apply custom filters
  * seam carving
* Lots of BFS!
* conjunctive normal form (CNF) boolean solver
* Object Oriented Programming
* Creating and traversing through custom-made graph datastructures
* Python-based LISP interpreter

Please feel free to reach out to me via linkedin if you would like to get in touch!
