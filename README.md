# About-Me
More insight into my other (private) projects and myself!

I am a sophomore at MIT studying 6-4 (Artificial Intelligence and Decision Making) with a minor in Economics. 

# Fall 2024 update
I have learned a lot in the last year! Here are some of my highlights:

* Internship at NVIDIA on the Vulkan Performance Team
  * Learned about OS architecture, project completed in C/C++, Python, and a hint of Perl
  * Project involved creating a memory profiler and optimizer to improve game performance, my work created up to a 18.5% speedup in FPS on select applications.
* I am now a Lab Assistant (LA) for 6.1010 (the class mentioned in my fall 2023 update)!
  * So far I am finding the work to be fulfilling and I am learning how to best find and communicate issues in student's code.
* Taking 6.C571/15.C571 (Optimization Methods)
  * The class is hands on and includes topics such as, liner optimization, network-flow optimization, integer optimization, and optimization under uncertainty
  * Code to be posted at the end of the semester :)

# Fall 2023 update
As of fall 2023, I have completed extensive lab-work in 6.1010 (Fundamentals in Programming) at MIT. Unfortunately, I cannot publish my work to the public (that is if I want to graduate without getting into serious trouble). Some of my favorite projects involved:

* Image processing
  * hand-programming kernels to apply custom filters
  * seam carving
* Lots of BFS and DFS!
* Conjunctive normal form (CNF) boolean solver - Sudoku Solver
* Object Oriented Programming
* Creating and traversing through custom-made graph datastructures
* Python-based LISP interpreter

Overall, I really enjoyed the clas and would love to TA it some time in the very near future.
